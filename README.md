## I store something about ***my experience and life***  here, just for fun and to help people (who haven't known me yet) gain some info about me.
-My original domain name under ***ustc.edu*** seems to have been deleted. As an alumnus, it's disheartening to lose that connection (Alumni, and now an elder alumnus) T_T. my alma mater finally decided to kick my webiste out
-Purchase new domain name "binlian.me" ($20/year, its hurt)
-Trying to keep updating something interesting through [my blog][https://killerlb-ustc.github.io/] and occasionally make updates here, lol.
-Trying to share some useful materials consistently update it whenever I have free time.

- 原来科大的域名似乎没了，作为毕业老人，被蜗壳给彻底扫地出门了，感谢白嫖了好久哈哈哈哈哈哈，估计也有安全方面的顾虑，毕竟尼科一直用的http。
- 20刀乐一年买了个新域名，心里痛，要付钱了，欢迎来到成年人的世界
